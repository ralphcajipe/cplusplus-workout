/** Problem
Use the variable x as you write this program. x will represent a positive integer. Write a program that determines if x is divisible by 5 and is an even number. If yes, print _ is divisible by 5 and even, where the blank (_) is the value of x. If no, print _ is not divisible by 5 or it is odd, where the blank (_) is the value of x.

**Type Casting**
Use the `to_string(x)` function to type cast the variable `x` as a string.

Expected Output
If x is 8, then the output should be: 8 is not divisible by 5 or it is odd.
If x is 80, then the output should be: 80 is divisible by 5 and even.
If x is 105, then the output should be: 105 is not divisible by 5 or it is odd.
