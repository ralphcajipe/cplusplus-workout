/** Problem
Use the variable x as you write this program. x will represent a string. Write a program that determines if x is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u ). If yes, print _ is a vowel, where the blank (_) is the value of x. If no, print _ is not a vowel, where the blank (_) is the value of x. For this particular exercise, make sure that your code specifically checks if the variable x is equivalent to the strings a, e, i, o, or u in lowercase. Otherwise, your test cases will fail.

IMPORTANT
There is a difference between the strings “a” and "A". When comparing strings, the system is case-sensitive and will attempt to match each character of the strings to each other based on whether it is uppercase or lowercase.

Expected Output
If x is a, then the output should be: a is a vowel.
If x is z, then the output should be: z is not a vowel.
